This project lets you easily convert an array of addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates, using Google's geocoding api

## Getting Started
Clone the repo, cd into it, then run `make bootstrap`

Jump into config.js and edit in your api key and array.

You can get an api key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key).  

## Running the script

Run `make start`

boom! you've got an output file called resultslatlong.txt with your new baddass lat long array! Or maybe your computer is telling you you've got some errors. If you do have errors, you probably forgot a step, like getting the api key.
